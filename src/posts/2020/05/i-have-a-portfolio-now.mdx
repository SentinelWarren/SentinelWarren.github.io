I am originally a front-end developer, who has been polishing his React and Gatsby Skills throughout the past year. But my current pursues of Data Science academically ended up hampering my progress where I couldn't find time for projects. At the start of the worldwide lockdown situation, I was determined to get at least a couple of projects completed during my time at home. The first one of those finalized was my Portfolio Website.

Throughout 2020, I started coming across more and more blog posts that emphasized Blog Post Syndication. And you know what, they sold the idea to me! I started researching various things from other dev portfolios/blogs to design systems for it. The recent [Blogging for Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) by [@monicalent](https://twitter.com/monicalent) acted as a reaffirmation of my plan. 

I found the [Terminal](https://gatsby-theme-terminal.netlify.app/) theme by [@PaulieScanlon](https://twitter.com/PaulieScanlon/) to be the perfect foundation for my plan and started working on the idea. Many developers go with building their portfolio from scratch. I felt it would be better to start with a solid base/starter rather than starting from nothing. It thereby highlights my ability to integrate with others with my custom touches to the base. What I envisioned was a website that gave the visitor a feel of editing his development environment, basically their virtual home. [My portfolio](https://amorpheuz.github.io/) is the initial interpretation of the plan!

As you might have noticed already, I feel developing a portfolio is a continuous process. The milestone I have reached feels a great stable before moving ahead, and thus I have decided to showcase it to get some feedback! Please do leave your feedback in the comments. üòÄ 

Before closing out, I would like to post a mix of my long and short term plans on what's next for my blog!

- Enable Canonical URLs after obtaining a custom domain.
- Start with syndication from my next blog post (Coming soon üòâ).

- Improve SEO with further research.
- Add support for the Hindi Language on the website, improve accessibility.
- Customize layouts and GraphQL queries to fetch more custom data.
- Add comments & interactivity to the website via serverless architecture.
- Integrate Projects & activity with GitHub API.
